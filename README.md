# Solving-the-Multi_Objective_KnapSack-problem-with-DeepLearning
The multi-objective KnapSack problem is a trending combinatorial optimisation subject that can be solved with metaheuristics, but this is computationally difficult and costly. Several studies have shown that Machine Learning can be a good alternative to solve such problems by predicting the optimal solution and this work is an initiative to materialize this theory. 

# How to run
Before execution, place the provided folder 'mkpInstances' under users/maily or users/'username'

# Note
It is importnant to insist on the fact this is an initiative or a first step towards the integration of artificial intelligence in the branch of combinatorial optimization, we are open for any suggestions or critics that would help improve it.
