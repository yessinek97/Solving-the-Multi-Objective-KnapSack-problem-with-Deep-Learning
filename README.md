# Solving-the-Multi_Objective_KnapSack-problem-with-DeepLearning
The multi-objective KnapSack is a trending combinatorial optimisation problem that can be solved with metaheuristics, but this is computationally difficult and costly. Several studies have shown that Machine Learning can be a good alternative to solve such problems by predicting the optimal solution and this work is an initiative to materialize this theory. 

# How to run
Before execution, place the provided folder 'mkpInstances' under users/maily or users/'username'

# Note
It is importnant to insist on the fact this is an initiative to leverage artificial intelligence (Deep Learning) in the field of combinatorial optimization, we are open for any suggestions or critics that would help improve it.
